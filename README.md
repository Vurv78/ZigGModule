## ZigGModule
This is a binary module for garrysmod written in Zig for fun.

May or may not continue this but Zig is considerably harder for me to work in because it's not even reached a stable point and is much more involved than other languages.

Just prints "Hello World!" in your chat by loading tier0.dll.  
Also loads lua_shared.dll.
